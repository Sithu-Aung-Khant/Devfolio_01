- I modified the font family for the website by configuring it in the tailwind.config.js file. The crucial decision was determining whether to place my fontFamily configuration within the themes bracket or the extend bracket. Convention suggests putting it in the extend bracket, but I wanted fontFamily as a default without specifying the font name for every element. Consequently, I chose to place it in the theme bracket, accepting the associated risk.

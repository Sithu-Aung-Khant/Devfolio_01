## Navbar

- To build navbar I want to try tailwind CSS, so now I will install tailwind CSS in my vite project.

- I modified the font family for the website by configuring it in the tailwind.config.js file. The crucial decision was determining whether to place my fontFamily configuration within the themes bracket or the extend bracket. Convention suggests putting it in the extend bracket, but I wanted fontFamily as a default without specifying the font name for every element. Consequently, I chose to place it in the theme bracket, accepting the associated risk.

### Light/Dark Mode

- Now, I want to add dark and light mode in my website. I have done it with scss but I haven't tried in react app with tailwind. So let's overcome this challenge.

- I wasn't able to implement dark mode today; I require a bit more knowledge on that. However, in the evening session, I successfully developed a responsive navbar. It is fully functional.

- I also customized the logo for both dark and light modes, incorporating my personal touch by tweaking it with my name. I am loving the result.
